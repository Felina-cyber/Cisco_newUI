# Quick Setup Guide - Fix 500 Error

## âœ… **Issue Fixed!**

The 500 Internal Server Error has been resolved. The Case automation agent now includes a **fallback system** that works without requiring a Groq API key.

## ðŸ”§ **What Was Fixed:**

1. **Fallback Routing**: Added keyword-based routing that works without API keys
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when Groq API is unavailable
3. **TypeScript Errors**: Fixed tool call type issues
4. **Image Warning**: Fixed aspect ratio warning for Cisco logo

## ðŸš€ **How to Test Right Now:**

1. **Restart your development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Click on any case** in the Worklist - it should now work!

3. **You'll see**:
   - "Routing..." indicator with spinning icon
   - "Routed" badge with green checkmark
   - Updated timeline showing the automation process
   - Routing information in the Case Detail panel

## ðŸŽ¯ **What the Fallback Does:**

The system now uses **smart keyword detection** to route cases:

- **Goal Explainer Agent**: Queries containing "goal", "quota", "portfolio"
- **Deal Status Agent**: Queries containing "deal", "order", "SO #"
- **Commission Agent**: Queries containing "commission", "payout", "rate"
- **Case Routing Agent**: Queries containing "escalate", "discrepancy", "resolve"

## ðŸ”‘ **To Use Full AI Routing (Optional):**

If you want to use the full Groq AI routing instead of the fallback:

1. **Get a Groq API key** from https://console.groq.com/
2. **Create `.env.local`** in the root directory:
   ```env
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.1-8b-instant
   ```
3. **Restart the server**

## ðŸŽ‰ **Current Status:**

âœ… **Working**: Case automation with fallback routing  
âœ… **Working**: Real-time status indicators  
âœ… **Working**: Enhanced timeline updates  
âœ… **Working**: Routing information display  
âœ… **Working**: Error handling and user feedback  

The Case automation agent is now fully functional and will route cases intelligently even without an API key!
