# Case Sorting Implementation

## Overview
The case management system now implements a priority-based sorting mechanism where cases must be resolved in order (Case 1, then Case 2, then Case 3, etc.).

## How It Works

### 1. Priority System
- Each case has a `priority` field (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.)
- Cases are sorted by priority in ascending order
- Only the first unresolved case and all previously resolved cases are shown

### 2. Case Resolution Flow
1. **Case 1** is always available first
2. User must resolve Case 1 before Case 2 becomes available
3. After resolving Case 1, Case 2 automatically becomes available
4. This pattern continues for all subsequent cases

### 3. Visual Indicators
- **Priority Badge**: Each case shows its priority number (#1, #2, etc.)
- **Resolved Status**: Resolved cases show a green checkmark and "Resolved" badge
- **Locked Status**: Unavailable cases show a lock icon and "Locked" badge
- **Active Case**: The current case is highlighted with a blue border

### 4. Resolution Process
1. Click on an available case to open it
2. Review the AI-generated response
3. Click "Resolve & Continue" to mark the case as resolved
4. The next case automatically becomes available and is selected

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure Changes
- Added `priority: number` field to `SellerCase` interface
- Added `isResolved: boolean` field (though we use a separate state for tracking)

### Component Updates
- **Worklist**: Shows priority numbers, resolution status, and availability
- **CaseDetail**: Shows priority number and includes resolve functionality
- **Main Page**: Manages case availability logic and automatic progression

### State Management
- `resolvedCases`: Set of resolved case IDs
- `availableCases`: Computed list of cases that should be visible
- `selectedId`: Currently selected case ID

## Benefits
- Ensures systematic case processing
- Prevents skipping important cases
- Provides clear visual feedback on progress
- Maintains workflow discipline
